# Timestamp Microservice

## User stories:
- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a Unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2018)
- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date
- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties
